This is a trivial excercise to pack a python script with its dependencies into a zip file.

### Pack

It should run with your python environment with the dependecies installed.
	
	python pack.py
	
The `exe.zip` file will be created in the `dist/` folder.
	
### Run

This can run without dependencies installed.

	python exe.zip
